# Oh My Gotto ! ! !

A simple rougelike game made in Java with [FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL).

Inspired by [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/).
& [Blue Archive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexon.bluearchive&hl=en).

Made it for my OOP class' final project &
~~Totally not a rip-off of [Genryumon Affairs](https://bluearchive.nexon.com/events/2025/03/minigame?code=en)~~.

# How to run?
Just download the latest release -> unzip -> run the app :3
